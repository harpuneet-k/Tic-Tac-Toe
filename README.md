# Tic-Tac-Toe
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe AI project! This repository features a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent. The AI is powered by the Minimax algorithm, ensuring optimal play. It never loses and always aims to either win or draw.


### Minimax Algorithm
The AI opponent is implemented using the Minimax algorithm, which is a decision-making algorithm used in game theory and artificial intelligence. The algorithm evaluates all possible moves and their outcomes to choose the move that maximizes the AI's chance of winning while minimizing the player's chance of winning.

### Game Flow
- Initialize the game: The game board is initialized as a 3x3 grid.
- Player's turn: The player chooses an empty cell to place their mark (O).
- AI's turn: The AI evaluates the board and chooses the optimal move.
- Check for win/draw: After each move, the game checks if there is a winner or if the game is a draw.
- Repeat: The turns alternate until there is a winner or the game ends in a draw.
